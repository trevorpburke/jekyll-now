Bay Area native, self-taught Python and SQL programmer, avid mountain biker and skier, YouTube cooking show enthusiast!

### Professional Background

Over the past few years I've been leveraging Python as a tool to retrieve, wrangle, and process data, from simple CSV files to massive SQL databases. In addition, I've written and refactored hundreds of PostgreSQL queries. This blog will serve as a source of tips and solutions to common data/engineering problems using Python and SQL.
